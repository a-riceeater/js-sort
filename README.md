# Javascript Sort

A javascript sorting library that contains almost every possible sorting algorithm to exist.


## Algorithms Included

- [Bogo Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort): Checks to see if the array is sorted, if it isn't randomize it until it is sorted. Avg. Speed is *Ø(n * n!)*

- [Bubble Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort): Compares adjacent items, if it is less than the current item, swap them. Avg. speed is *O(n^2)*
- [Selection Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort): Finds the smallest item in the array, puts it in order and repeats until the array is sorted. Avg. Speed is *O(n^2)*
- [Heap Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort): Avg. speed is *O(n log n)*
- [Stalin Sort](https://github.com/gustavo-depaula/stalin-sort): Any item that isn't in order is removed, or sent to the gulag. Avg. speed is *O(n)*
- [Quick Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort): It selects a 'pivot' from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays based on whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The pivot is then placed in its correct position in the sorted array, and the process is recursively applied to the sub-arrays Avg. speed is *O(n log n)*
