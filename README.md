A javascript sorting library that contains almost every possible sorting algorithm to exist.


## Algorithms Included

- [Bogo Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort): Checks to see if the array is sorted, if it isn't randomize it until it is sorted. Avg. Speed is Ã˜(n * n!)

- [Bubble Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort): Compares adjacent items, if it is less than the current item, swap them. Avg. speed is O(n^2)
- [Selection Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort): Finds the smallest item in the array, puts it in order and repeats until the array is sorted. Avg. Speed is O(n^2)
- [Heap Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort): Avg. speed is O(n log n)
